# Initial Set Up
This project showcases my ability to configure multiple network devices and implement security measures.
I have set up a ROAS Configuration, 1 Router, 1 Switch, 2 End Host PCs
PC1 is in VLAN 10 (Marketing), and PC2 is in VLAN 20 (Sales)
PC1 is in 172.16.0.0/16 while PC2 is in 192.168.0.0/24
The Router is set up to accept multiple VLANs on a single interface.
Both PCs can ping each other and have full connectivity.
